I have successfully completed a data analysis project using Python, specifically focusing on a movie industry dataset. 
Throughout the project,demonstrated how to clean and analyze the data, visualize correlations between various features (such as budget and gross revenue),
and ultimately draw insights about what factors might influence a movie's financial success.

Final Insights: It is acknowledged that the initial hypothesis about the influence of the production company on gross revenue was not supported by the data, 
while the budget and votes were found to be more significant factors on the Gross of the movie.
